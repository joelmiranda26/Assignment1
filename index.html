            <h2>About Web Experience</h2>
            <p><div>During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to collaborate on a group project focused on developing a web application. 
			Our project revolved around creating a furniture website that we later hosted on a server using XAMPP. 
			In this venture, I actively participated in both front-end and back-end development.</div><br>

			<div>In the realm of front-end development, we leveraged HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. 
			HTML allowed us to structure the web pages, while CSS helped us style and design the website. 
			However, I found that CSS could be challenging to manage, especially when implementing new features and ensuring a consistent and polished appearance across the site.</div><br>

			<div>On the back-end side of the project, we employed SQL to manage the database. 
			We designed the system to enable users to create personal accounts, search for their desired furniture items, and seamlessly book their selected items. 
			This dual role, involving both front-end and back-end development, provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the web application development process.</div><br>

			<div>One of the most rewarding aspects of the project was the ability to empower users to engage with the platform and personalize their furniture shopping experience. 
			This project deepened my passion for web development and equipped me with valuable skills and experiences in the field. </div><br></p>
